BRAC University | Summer 2025

This repository contains organized resources, lecture notes, assignments, and study materials related to the **CSE422: Artificial Intelligence** course offered by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at **BRAC University**.

## üìö Course Overview
CSE422 introduces the foundational concepts, techniques, and algorithms in Artificial Intelligence. Topics covered include:
- Introduction to the concept of Artificial Intelligence, rationality.
- Analysis different problem-solving strategies for informed, uninformed problems, deterministic or stochastic games, and constraint satisfaction problem.
- Presentation of different algorithms and the analysis of complexity, optimality and completeness of these algorithms.
- Developing the critical skill to formulate problems and strategies to solve problems.
- Introduction to the concept of uncertain knowledge and probabilistic reasoning.
- Introduction to probabilistic and logic models so the students will be able to use these models in various decision-making problems.
- Introduction to the basic concept of machine learning.
